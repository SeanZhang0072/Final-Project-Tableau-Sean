# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
In this project, my aim was to dive deep into the Airbnb market in New York City, analyzing the impact of different factors including property types, room types, number of beds, and prices, and how these factors affect the usage and popularity of Airbnb.

## Process
### Step 1: Initially, I conducted a thorough research of the five main parts of New York City, understanding the properties of each area and their possible impact on Airbnb business.

### Step 2: I gathered and cleaned the data on New York Airbnb for further analysis.

### Step 3: I then statistically analyzed room types from the year 2008 and discovered that entire homes were the most popular. This seems to suggest that more and more people are beginning to use their second homes as Airbnb rentals.

### Step 4: I delved into the average number of beds and the pricing to reveal their relationships with property types and areas.

### Step 5: Finally, I created a series of visualizations to intuitively demonstrate the main findings from the analysis.

## Results
I chose Option 2, using the Airbnb dataset from New York City. I created visualizations that showed the distribution and trends of property types, number of beds, and prices. I chose this approach as it makes the information more visually understandable and easier to explain. My data question was: How do different property attributes, room types, number of beds, and prices impact Airbnb's usage and popularity? By reading and analyzing the prompts, I discovered that entire homes and private rooms dominate the Airbnb market in New York City.

## Challenges 
The main challenges I faced in this project involved effectively handling and analyzing a large amount of data and determining which factors have the most significant impact on the use and popularity of Airbnb. I also had to understand the property market in New York City to interpret the data accurately.

## Future Goals
Given more time, I would further analyze other factors that could impact Airbnb's usage and popularity, such as customer reviews and available dates. Additionally, I would like to explore the Airbnb markets in other cities to see if there are similar trends and patterns.
